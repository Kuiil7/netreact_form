    In my experience, I always make things better.  My career began in Sales and Marketing with MCI WorldCom while a college undergrad specializing in telecommunications on a national scale. Through the years, I have worked for Sorenson, Z, and AT&T, and Gallaudet University. Most recently, I obtained my Master of Arts in linguistics. While there, I realized that coding has always been my passion.
